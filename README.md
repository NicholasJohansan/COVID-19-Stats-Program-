# COVID-19-Stats-Program-
COVID-19 SG Stats Program (Web Scraper) made with Python

A Software Python GUI made by @NJ889.
It presents statistics on the COVID19 situation.
Features:
- Singapore Statistics
- Global Statistics
- Top5 Countries Statistics.

More Info/Help can be found under the "Help/Info" button on the program.

Be mindful that this program is developed in Singapore and focuses on maintaining the Singapore Statistics.
Therefore, should the data fail for the other statistics, try clicking on "Update Stats" at least 2-5 times.
If the problem still proceeds, you may contact me at ncov19.gspread@gmail.com to fix the issue.

Have a nice experience!
